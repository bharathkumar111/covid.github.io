                        Modern zoos try not only to be for people's entertainment, but for education, research, and the conservation and protection of animals. Many zoos are centers where rare animals are preserved when they are in danger of dying out. These modern zoos also want to give the animals a natural life, so that they are healthy and behave normal. This is done for the animals, but also that people can see the animals as if they were in nature, and not in a zoo.

                        Zoos cost money. They educate the public on the biological diversity that makes up the world. They help people and wildlife successfully coexist. They pursue continuing research and education for people. They preserve crucial natural resources. They work to ensure zoos can provide the most natural environment possible for wildlife in its care. Without enough money they cannot do these things.
                        
                        Many zoos are not like the modern type of zoo. There the animals are held in bad conditions. They are kept in small cages, and they are bored and get sick.

                                The mission of the Zoological Society of Doll is to take part in conserving wildlife and endangered species, to educate people about the importance of wildlife and the environment, and to support the DOLL County Zoo.

                                With education as a core component of the Society mission, we are one of the largest zoo education programs in the country, hosting approximately 300,000 encounters with guests annually. We educate about wildlife and the environment through several interactive, hands-on programs onsite at the Doll County Zoo or at your location, including: fall, winter and spring classes for all ages; summer camps; school programs and Doll Wild Theater.

                                One of my favorite things to do as a family is to visit a zoo. I love witnessing the wonder and amazement in my boys’ eyes as they see an animal for the first (2nd and 3rd) time! Their faces light up and their smiles come alive as they point to each animal in excitement.

                                According to the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, zoos and aquariums have over 181 million visitors each year. We have already shared the many benefits of visiting an aquarium, so now it’s time to take a closer look at zoos. Visiting a zoo offers so many incredible learning opportunities. While having a fun day exploring, kids will develop valuable skills and obtain priceless knowledge. A day at the zoo also encourages a healthy lifestyle while bringing family and friends together. It is the perfect day trip destination for any season!
                                
                                There are so many amazing benefits to visiting a zoo that is was difficult to narrow the list down.

                                <h2>Enhanced Language Development</h2>
                                As children walk around the zoo, they are exposed to words and concepts. It also encourages dialogue between parents, children and even siblings. While walking around with your child, it is important to label every animal and ask questions. This will help increase their vocabulary and comprehension skills.
                                
                                <h2>Promotes Family Bonding</h2>
                                Visiting a zoo is the perfect way to spend a day together as a family. Grandparents, parents, cousins and siblings can all find something to enjoy at the zoo. One of my fondest recent memories is visiting the Turtle Back Zoo with my mom, grandmother and two boys. It was an exciting and magical day for everyone!

                                <h2>Attend Special Events and Activities</h2>
                                Many zoos offer exciting and educational activities and special events. For example, Turtle Back Zoo and Cape May County Zoo both offer night-time programs where visitors get a first hand look at how animals behave and interact at night. Other events may include conservation days and days dedicated to specific animals. Seasonal events such as the holiday lights at Turtle Back Zoo and Zoo Boo at the Bergen County Zoo are also great events for families to enjoy.
                                
                                <h2>Encourages Environmental Awareness</h2>
                                Visiting a zoo helps children understand the importance of taking care of the environment as it has a significant impact on the lives and welfare of animals. Zoos also teach families about the importance of conservation and animal care. Children can especially learn about the impact humans have on animals at Popcorn Zoo as this zoo only takes in animals that are sick, elderly, abandoned, abused or injured. Visitors can learn the unique story about each animal as they walk around the zoo.

                          <h2>      Offers Educational Programs</h2>
                                Most zoos offer educational programming including camps that help children become more aware of animal behavior, care and conservation. These programs, like the ones offered at The Bergen County Zoo, offer a structured, fun and hands-on learning environment for kids and families. They often include stories, songs, crafts and activities. These multi-sensory based learning programs are perfect for instilling knowledge about animals.
                                
                                <h2>Great Exercise</h2>
                                Most zoos cover a vast amount of land which allows for ample exercise. Space Farms Zoo, for instance, has wide open spaces including several hills which is perfect for getting the heart pumping. Many zoos also provide playground areas for children to work those gross motor skills while making new friends. My favorite zoo playground is the Prehistoric Playground at the Turtle Back Zoo.

                                The bonobo (Pan paniscus) has captured the attention of conservationists and scientists in recent decades. Like its chimpanzee cousin, the bonobo shares over 98% of its DNA with humans. Unlike chimpanzees, bonobo society tends to be more peaceful and bonobo groups are led by females.

            Wild bonobos are only found in the forests south of the Congo River system in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Classified as endangered, bonobos are threatened by poaching and habitat loss. Bonobos are also rare in captivity; only seven accredited zoological facilities in North Indian house these rare great apes.

          For more than three decades, the Zoological Society of Doll has advanced the conservation of wild and captive bonobos. To learn about the Zoological Society award-winning Bonobo & Congo Biodiversity Initiative (BCBI) and the Bonobo Species Survival Plan (SSP).   </p1>
