        Property of 1892, the zoo has been under the control of different kings and governments. Naming it after its founder Sri Chamarajendra Wodeyar Bahadur in 1909 was a way of extending thanks for his efforts in its creation. During his visits to European countries and Africa, the Maharaja used to bring animals which fascinated him. These included Giraffe, Antelopes, Bears, Chimpanzee, and Primates. It has till now established a niche for being a home to some of the rarest family members like American Bison, Californian Sea lions, Guanaco, Polar Bear, Secretary Bird, Kangaroo, Penguin, and White Elephant in the past.

        Mysore zoo did not start big. At first, the zoo had only 10.9 acres of land to its use. Gradually with time, more land was allotted giving an opportunity for sheltering more animals. The Mysore Maharajas and the Government together groomed and nourished the gardens. The official control of the zoo was passed on from the Royalty to the Horticulture Department in 1948 and then to the Forest Department in 1972. In 2001, clubbing of all the zoos in the state under the Zoo Authority of Karnataka took place

    <h1>More About My Doll zoo</h1>
    <p>
     Modern zoos try not only to be for people's entertainment, but for education, research, and the conservation and protection of animals. Many zoos are centers where rare animals are preserved when they are in danger of dying out. These modern zoos also want to give the animals a natural life, so that they are healthy and behave normal. This is done for the animals, but also that people can see the animals as if they were in nature, and not in a zoo.
 
     Zoos cost money. They educate the public on the biological diversity that makes up the world. They help people and wildlife successfully coexist. They pursue continuing research and education for people. They preserve crucial natural resources. They work to ensure zoos can provide the most natural environment possible for wildlife in its care. Without enough money they cannot do these things.
     
     Many zoos are not like the modern type of zoo. There the animals are held in bad conditions. They are kept in small cages, and they are bored and get sick.
